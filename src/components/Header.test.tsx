    // We need to find this button.
    // It's often a <DialogClose asChild> wrapping a <Button variant="ghost" size="icon">.
    // If there's no specific label, we can look for a button that contains an 'X' or related path.
    // For now, let's assume the Escape key test is primary, and this is a fallback.
    // A more specific selector might be needed if the X button needs direct testing.
    // Due to the nested nature of the 'X' button in Shadcn Dialogs, directly selecting it
    // without more details on its exact DOM structure (e.g. an explicit aria-label) is tricky.
